# Economic approach
## Carbon credits
* Carbon credits system: a global economic system to financially incentivize companies to reduce their carbon emissions [Goodell, 142][Goodell]
* [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) established the carbon credits system in 1997/enforced 2005. [Goodell, 142][Goodell]
* Carbon credits are a part of a "cap and trade" mechanism. Governments set upper limits on allowable greenhouse gas emissions by industry and region. Companies that use less than their allotment can sell their "unused" credits to companies that will exceed their cap. [Lovins, 225][Lovins]
* Prior art: the Acid Rain Program cut sulfur dioxide emissions quickly and cheaply using a similar credits system [Goodell, 141][Goodell]

### Kyoto Protocol implementation details
* Flexible mechanism: the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) carbon offset projects in developing countries [presumably, with unregulated markets] can be used to generate credits sellable in regulated markets [Lovins, 226][Lovins]
* Flexible mechanism: Joint Implementation (JI)
* First phase of Kyoto Protocol ended 2012 [TODO: look up retrospectives]

### Controversy

#### Pro carbon credits
* The system sets a cap on the total allowable quantity of emissions globally (in theory)
* The mechanism creates a "scarcity" of allowable emissions and thus lets market dynamics make reduced emissions a good business decision (you don't just save money, but stand to make some)

#### Anti carbon credits
* This is challenging to regulate and enforce
* The carbon credit system is an opt-in economy, and many major countries (esp. the United States) do not opt in
* As emissions are reduced globally, the incentive to reduce goes away again - you would expect the value of a carbon credit to decrease over time as companies make up-front investments in more efficient/less emissive systems. [right? This is my analysis - wouldn't the government have to keep cutting and cutting the caps to make this work? I haven't seen anything about a long-term plan to this effect]

## Capitalism
* Using less energy/using renewables can save companies money - Walmart is a leading example [Lovins, 12][Lovins]
* Companies required to disclose accounting information including carbon footprint under the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanesâ€“Oxley_Act). This lets the public see economic effect of cutting emissions; the trend has been cost savings [Lovins, 11][Lovins]
* Major $ savings to be had in more efficient buildings; 76% of energy produced in USA goes to building operation [Lovins, 15][Lovins]
* Biggest blocker to companies that would like to go greener (more efficient/renewable): up-front capital [Lovins, 31][Lovins]
* Utilities: some are publicly owned; some are from private investment. Particularly those with private investment stand to gain from clients using more energy. In the 1970s they even sold in declining block rates. PUC for each state sets rates, some use inverted rates and some decouple energy quantity from $ paid to utility company. Some reward utility companies for reducing client consumption (ex. Batinovich Plan) [Lovins, 47-48][Lovins]
