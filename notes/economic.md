# Economic approach
## Carbon credits
* Carbon credits system: a global economic system to financially incentivize companies to reduce their carbon emissions [p142][Goodell]
* [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) established the carbon credits system in 1997/enforced 2005. Each nation decides on a cap, then can trade for more/less with other nations [p142][Goodell]
* Prior art: the Acid Rain Program cut sulfur dioxide emissions quickly and cheaply using a similar credits system [p141][Goodell]

## Capitalism
* Using less energy/using renewables can save companies money - Walmart is a leading example [p12][Lovins]
* Companies required to disclose accounting information including carbon footprint under the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanesâ€“Oxley_Act). This lets the public see economic effect of cutting emissions; the trend has been cost savings [p11][Lovins]
* Major $ savings to be had in more efficient buildings; 76% of energy produced in USA goes to building operation [p15][Lovins]
* Biggest blocker to companies that would like to go greener (more efficient/renewable): up-front capital [p31][Lovins]
* Utilities: some are publicly owned; some are from private investment. Particularly those with private investment stand to gain from clients using more energy. In the 1970s they even sold in declining block rates. PUC for each state sets rates, some use inverted rates and some decouple energy quantity from $ paid to utility company. Some reward utility companies for reducing client consumption (ex. Batinovich Plan) [p47-48][Lovins]
