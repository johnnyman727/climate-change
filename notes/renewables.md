# Renewable energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* Solar and wind are currently expensive to implement, but it's possible to significantly reduce cost for materials/transport/setup without a technological breakthrough, e.g. wind turbines on kites [Victor]
* Improved software, especially modeling (where should my wind turbine go?) can dramatically increase the efficiency of existing technologies [Victor]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
* Solar thermal: heat water from the sun. 1 in 10 houses in China, not so many in the States [p66][Lovins]
* Wind: fastest growing renewable. Solar electric is second [p71][Lovins]
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [p75][Lovins]
* One nuclear power plant produces 1gW. Geothermal across the states produces 2gW [Lovins]
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [p77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [p78][Lovins]
* Electric demand of the U.S. could be met by covering 9% of Nevada with PV according to DoE report [p72][Lovins]
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [p72][Lovins]
* Nuclear power: contentious. Some argue that it's the best way to get off oil dependency; others say it's not worth the waste it creates
* Biochar: as plants grow, they pull CO2 out of the air, but they release it again when they decay. Instead of letting it decay, heat woody material at low temperature anaerobically until it is carbonized (pyrolysis). Use this material as a fertilizer - dug into the ground, carbon is sequestered. Byproduct is biodiesel. [p199-200][Lovins]
