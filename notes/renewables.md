# Renewable energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* "clean coal": idea whereby coal-fired plants capture CO2 before it leaves the smokestack and bury it (sequester) in the earth. Mechanism: pressurized CO2 injected into saline aquifers below impermeable caprock - 1k-8k feet deep. There, it would form mild carbonic acid, which would dissolve and precipitate out as dolomite and limestone [Weisman, 223][Weisman]

## Wind
* Wind: fastest growing renewable. Solar electric is second [Lovins, 71][Lovins]
* Solar and wind are currently expensive to implement, but it's possible to significantly reduce cost for materials/transport/setup without a technological breakthrough, e.g. wind turbines on kites [Victor]
* Improved software, especially modeling (where should my wind turbine go?) can dramatically increase the efficiency of existing technologies [Victor]
* "In 2014, the average cost of Power Purchase Agreements for new wind power in the US was around 2.35 cents per kwh, the lowest it has ever been. In the windiest parts of the great plains, prices are as low as 2 cents per kwh." [Naam][NaamWind]
* ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/US-Wind-Power-Capacity-at-80-110-and-140-meter-hub-heights-2-million-square-km-above-60-percent-Capacity-at-140m-NREL-800x581.jpg) "next-generation wind turbines could reach an incredible capacity factor of 60% over 2 million square kilometers of the US, or enough to provide roughly 10x as much electricity as the US uses" [Naam][NaamWind]
* New natural gas electricity is 7c/kwH; new wind power (unsubsidized) costs an average of 4c/kwH or less [Naam][NaamWind]

## Solar
* Electric demand of the U.S. could be met by covering 9% of Nevada with PV according to DoE report [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* Solar thermal: heat water from the sun. 1 in 10 houses in China, not so many in the States [Lovins, 66][Lovins]
* "This is a ~16% learning rate, meaning that every doubling of utility-scale solar capacity in the US leads to a roughly 16% reduction in the cost of electricity from new solar installations." [Naam][NaamSolar]
* "If current rates of improvement hold, solar will be incredibly cheap by the time it’s a substantial fraction of the world’s electricity supply." ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Future-Solar-Cost-Projections-PPA-LCOE.jpg) [Naam][NaamSolar]
* At the scale of utility installations, the cost of solar modules are now less than half of the price of delpoying solar. Inverters, labor, grid connection, and other soft costs are now higher. [Naam][NaamSolar]

## Biofuel
* Biochar: as plants grow, they pull CO2 out of the air, but they release it again when they decay. Instead of letting it decay, heat woody material at low temperature anaerobically until it is carbonized (pyrolysis). Use this material as a fertilizer - dug into the ground, carbon is sequestered. Byproduct is biodiesel. [Lovins, 199-200][Lovins]
* Biodiesel: can be made out of many things - not just waste oil and food but also "trash" such as dirty diapers and styrofoam cups. Typically, these types of solutions create cellulosic ethanol [Lovins, 162-163][Lovins]
* Brazil weaned themselves off of global oil dependency via the National Alcohol Program (1975). Required oil company to blend at least 22% ethanol (made from local sugarcane) into its fuel, while offering low-interest loans. [Lovins, 160][Lovins]
* Issues with upstream emissions (e.g. deforestation for plantation of fuel-source plants) crimp spread of biofuel as savior [Lovins, 161][Lovins]

## Geothermal
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [Lovins, 75][Lovins]
* One nuclear power plant produces 1gW. Geothermal across the states produces 2gW [Lovins]

## Wave
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [Lovins, 77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [Lovins, 78][Lovins]

## Nuclear
* Nuclear power: contentious. Some argue that it's the best way to get off oil dependency; others say it's not worth the waste it creates
* Current nuclear (fission) power works by creating heat through controlled atomic reactions, using this to boil water and create steam to drive a turbine. Specifically, all current nuclear plants use moveable cadmium rods to dampen or intensify the reaction (the rods suck up neutrons). [Weisman, 209][Weisman]
* Biggest nuclear plant in the United States: Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, west of Phoenix. Produces 3.8 billion watts [Weisman, 209][Weisman]
* Mechanism at Palo Verde: Cadmium dampers are interspersed with 170,000 cm-ish thick 14' hollow rods made of zirconium alloy stuffed with uranium pellets. Each rod contains the same amount of energy as 1 ton coal. Water flows through the rod assemblies to be heated. [Weisman, 210][Weisman]
* The volume of used nuclear fuel rods created over the past 40 years is 74,258 metric tons. That's one football field, 8 yards deep. [NEI]
* Used nuclear fuel is up to a million times more radioactive than when it was fresh. It is mutated into isotopes of plutonium and americum as it decays [Weisman, 210][Weisman]

### Side: anti-nuclear
* New nuclear plants cost $0.25 per kWh. Compared to efficiency solutions and other renewables, this is too expensive (wind in a good site: $0.03/kWh, solar on a good day: $0.12/kWh) [Lovins, 84][Lovins]
* Reductions in carbon emissions need to take place on the scale of one to two years; it takes 10 years to get a new nuclear plant online (not including permitting/bureaucracy) [Lovins, 84][Lovins]
* Replacing the world's coal plants with nuclear plants increases the accessibility of raw materials for nuclear bombs globally [Lovins, 84][Lovins]
* Nuclear power plants require a lot of water; climate change causes droughts. This will increase operational expenses to unsustainable levels (and already has at some now-closed sites) [Lovins, 85][Lovins]
* There is no solution in place for safe disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants [Lovins, 85][Lovins]
* Fossil fuels in large quantity are burned to mine, transport, and enrich uranium, as well as in the 10-19 years it takes to build a new plant [Klein, 125][Klein]

### Side: pro-nuclear
* Nearly one hundred nuclear facilities in 30 states provide nearly 20 percent of all U.S. electricity. [NEI]
* Nuclear energy facilities are used at high capacity compared to other energy generation mechanisms. They operate at a 92% energy capacity factor, compared to 47.8% for natural gas, 60.9% for coal, and 33.9% for wind. [NEI] (though - is this a meaningful statistic? Doesn't seem useful to me)
* One uranium fuel pellet creates as much energy as one ton of coal or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. [NEI]
* Significant uranium resources are available from U.S. sources or friendly trading partners such as Canada and Australia. [NEI]
* A nuclear energy facility’s life-cycle carbon emissions—including mining and producing fuel and construction of the plant—are among the lowest of any electricity generation source at 13 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt-hour, comparable to geothermal (15 tons) and wind (12 tons). [NEI]
* All U.S. nuclear energy facilities have extensive environmental monitoring programs, which are under the oversight of the NRC and state regulators. [NEI]

## Power grid - implementation changes
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
