# Effects of climate change

## Mass extinctions
* There have been five major extinction events in known natural history where species diversity plummeted in a short period of time – called the "Big Five". We are currently in a period of possibly similar extinction event proportions, likely caused by humans. Theorists are already terming this the "Sixth Extinction." [Kolbert, 3][Kolbert]
* The change in temperature projected by 2100 is ~as big as the temperature swings of the ice ages, but at least 10 times faster. In order for organisms to survive, they will have to adapt an order of magnitude faster than they have before. [Kolbert, 161-162][Kolbert]
* Species-area relationship: S = cA^z where z is less than 1. S=number of species, A=area, c=some constant (asymptotal graph). As conditions change, directly or indirectly by climate, a species's ability to adapt or move (incl. dispersal over generations) to stay in favorable conditions determines its survival. Based on this, about 24% (pretty definitely this order of magnitude) of species will be committed to extinction by 2050 if current climate change rates continue. This puts the current extinction at a "lesser" extinction level compared to the earth's history, not quite on par with a big five extinction event [Kolbert, 166-168][Kolbert]
* Salmon as particular case study: 5 major factors influencing are harvest (overfishing), hydropower (dams), habitat, hatcheries [Montgomery, 5][Montgomery]
* Salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest are stronger when the ocean's surface climate is cooler. This happens with a periodicity (opposite Alaska's) every 25 to 30 years. Cooler in 2001ish [Montgomery, 43][Montgomery]

## Glacier retreat
* In Glacier Bay (AK), ice front surveyed by Cook in late 1700s retreated 50 miles by 1980s [Montgomery, 32][Montgomery]

## Desertification
* Desertification: forces massive migration of villages (and cities) [Larsson]
* In order to stop desertification, you need to make something that will catch sand and keep it from blowing past its borders and taking in more land. E.g. wall of trees [Larsson]
* Around the Sahara, people are often poor and will chop down trees planted as sandbreak for firewood. Larsson proposes sandbreak made of sandstone, hardened by some bugs [Larsson]

# Adaptation
* Adaptation to climate change effects has become an emerging market segment. [Lovins, 252][Lovins]
* Some worry that focus on adaptation will create financial incentives for climate change acceleration. Others argue that we will need adaptation services/technologies regardless of how fast we curb emissions, so we should start now.
