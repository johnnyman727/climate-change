# Effects of climate change

## Mass extinctions
* There have been five major extinction events in known natural history where species diversity plummeted in a short period of time – called the "Big Five". We are currently in a period of possibly similar extinction event proportions, likely caused by humans. Theorists are already terming this the "Sixth Extinction." [Kolbert, 3][Kolbert]

## Ocean dead zones
* Runoff: fertilizers and pesticides, lawn maintenance, etc. leach into the ocean. Because of this, there are now more than 400 "dead zones" in the ocean, where nitrogen & phosphorous excess from this runoff cause algal blooms. Decomposition of these vast quantities of algae sucks oxygen from the surrounding water, making an oxygen-free space where sea creatures often cannot survive. [Barber, 216][Barber]

## Phytoplankton death and positive feedback cycles
* Phytoplankton levels are good indicators to ocean environment changes. They are the basic/lowest food on the food chain. There has been a 40% decline in phytoplankton since 1950. [Barber, 217][Barber]
* Impacts of phytoplankton decline (we see this on a small scale during El Nino climate cycles): seabirds and marine mammals starve and die. Phytoplankton typically release the sulfurous gases which help in cloud formation, so less phytoplankton --> less cloud cover --> lower albedo --> faster global warming. Phytoplankton use photosynthesis to convert CO2 into O2 for the air, usually this accounts for 50% of the oxyen production on earth (but we'll have less if the phytoplankton die). Phytoplankton typically serve as a carbon sink when they die and sink to the bottom of the ocean. [Barber, 217-218][Barber]
* "A 40 percent decline in phytoplankton makes the destruction of the rainforests seem almost insignificant by comparison. If there is less phytoplankton to store carbon, there's less of a buffer against global warming. More than that, it increases the inevitability of a disastrous positive feedback cycle in which warmer water supports fewer phytoplankton, which then take up less CO2 from the atmosphere, which causes the surface water to warm even more to the greenhouse effect. And on it goes." [Barber, 218][Barber]

## Desertification
* Desertification: forces massive migration of villages (and cities) [Larsson]
* In order to stop desertification, you need to make something that will catch sand and keep it from blowing past its borders and taking in more land. E.g. wall of trees [Larsson]
* Around the Sahara, people are often poor and will chop down trees planted as sandbreak for firewood. Larsson proposes sandbreak made of sandstone, hardened by some bugs [Larsson]

# Adaptation
* Adaptation to climate change effects has become an emerging market segment. [Lovins, 252][Lovins]
* Some worry that focus on adaptation will create financial incentives for climate change acceleration. Others argue that we will need adaptation services/technologies regardless of how fast we curb emissions, so we should start now.
