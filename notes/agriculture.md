# Agriculture
* Modern agriculture is highly connected with climate change, particularly: practices dependent on fossil fuels, land usage and deforestation, chemical sprays (herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, etc.), transportation/refrigeration/packaging/retail [Lovins, 178][Lovins]

## Organic farming
* In theory, healthy plants don't need pesticides. Pests typically attack stressed plants. [Barber, 53][Barber]
* Weeds don't matter if they are not competing with the primary plant. Make conditions optimal for the plant you want and you might get "weeds" but you won't have a weed problem (they will become the stressed plant) [Barber, 57][Barber]
* You can identify the needs of the soil by the types of weeds that grow there
* Grazing animals seek varied and nutritious diets. That's why you see them reaching through fencelines. [Barber, 61][Barber]
* Weeds will grow where the soil is best suited to them. You can use the weeds to identify soil needs: chicory, Queen Anne's lace, and wild carrot grow where there is low fertility. Milkweed shows low zinc. Wild garlic and yellow flowers mean there is low sulfur. [Barber, 57-58, 65][Barber]
* Spelt builds deep root systems and creates soil aeration. Clover captures nitrogen from the air and fixes it in the soil and carbon from the process keeps the nitrogen stable so it doesn't run off like chemical fertilizer. [Barber, 63][Barber]
* Soil management - nutrients, minerals, fertilizer content- create the end taste of the crop [Barber, 68][Barber]
* Plant flavor can be measured with a refractometer to find Brix, which has enormous impact on food flavor. Commonly used with wine grapes. [Barber, 81][Barber]
* Monocultures make entire crops susceptible to disease - all or nothing [Barber, 82][Barber]
* "The overproduction of grain helps enable the overproduction of chicken, which lowers the price of chicken, which means even more chickens are raised to make up for declining revenue. That leads to even more unneeded chicken [the parts that aren't breasts and thighs]. So it's fed to other animals it probably shouldn't be fed to, like fish (which are increasingly farm-raised, in part due to the offshore pollution caused by producing too much grain)." [Barber, 157][Barber]
* Our food systems were originally driven by what the land could produce; it's now driven by what eaters want to consume - which leads to a lot of wasted animal parts when we only buy the choicest cuts [Barber, 156][Barber]
