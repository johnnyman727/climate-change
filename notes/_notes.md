# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* Global emissions dipped in 2009 (likely due to the financial crisis) and increased 5.9% in 2010 - largest absolute increase since the Industrial Revolution [Klein, 20][Klein]
* The ~500 million richest humans on earth are responsible for about half of global emissions [Klein, 104][Klein]
* Public spending on the level of wartime expenditures need to occur in order to prevent catastrophic levels of global warming and to mitigate the effects which will reach us. This is largely energy efficiency and public transit expenditure. [Klein, 99][Klein]
* In order to have a 50% chance of keeping below the agreed-upon international target of no more than 2 degrees C of warming, all wealthy countries need to start cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 8-10% immediately [Klein, 81][Klein]
* In the neoliberal era, the rate of emissions growth had been declining: 4.5% annual increases in the 1960s were down to 1% annual increase in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2008, they shot up to 3.4%/year [Klein, 74][Klein]
* Countries are currently allocated responsible for emissions created in their country, not for emissions caused by their consumption. Shipping/etc. in the open ocean is not accounted for. [Klein, 73][Klein]
* Klein's analysis on successful movements for the environment in the last several years: Blockadia (civil disobedience), fossil fuel divestment/reinvestment movement,local laws against high-risk extraction, court challenges by Indigenous groups. [Klein, 407][Klein]
* New oil extraction processes consume much more water than conventional practices. It takes 2.3 barrels of water to produce one barrel of oil from tar sands mining, compared to 0.1-0.3 barres of water for a barrel of conventional crude. [Klein, 312][Klein]
* Modern fracking takes 70-300x the amount of fluid (usually water + sand) used in traditional fracking. This fluid often becomes toxic, radioactive waste. 280 billions of this waste were created from fracking in 2012. [Klein, 312][Klein]
* In 2012, there were more than 6,000 spills and "other mishaps" at onshore oil and gas sites in the Unites States. This is up ~17% from 2010 in states where comparable data was available. [Klein, 299][Klein]
* Cleanups of oil/gas spills are getting less effective: in 2005-2006, pipeline operators report recovering more than 60% of liquids spilled; in 2007-2010, operators recovered less than a third. [Klein, 299][Klein]
* More than 15 million Americans live within a mile of a well that has been drilled and fracked since 2000 [Klein, 282][Klein]
* The number of oil-carrying rail cars has increased from 9,500 in 2008 to 400,000 in 2013 (4,111% in five years) [Klein, 280][Klein]
* Gas flaring in Nigeria is extremely damaging. If the natural gas were captured, it could power the entire country. Instead, it is set on fire and accounts for 40% of Nigeria's CO2 emissions. [Klein, 275][Klein]
* In Nigeria, foreign-investment oil has spilled an Exxon Valdez worth of oil on the Niger Delta every year for ~50 years [Klein, 275][Klein]
* Natural gas has been argued for as a "clean alternative" to oil, but fracked natural gas may emit enough methane to make it comparable in "dirtiness" to coal [Klein, 192][Klein]
* The vast majority of new gas projects in North America rely on fracking [Klein, 192][Klein]
* Principles from the "golden age" of environmental legislation: ban/severely limit the offending activity/substance. Where possible, get the offender to pay for the cleanup. [Klein, 183][Klein]
* The amount of carbon that can be burned between 2011 and 2049 to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees celcius is 565 gigatons. Reserves already claimed by all fossil fuel companies for oil, gas, and coal amounts to 2,795 gigatons of carbon. [Klein, 134][Klein]
* Methane has a warming potential 86 times greater than carbon dioxide [Klein, 130][Klein]
* Bitumen is roughly 3-4 times as greenhouse intensive as coal due to its extraction process [Klein, 127][Klein]
* American farms overproduce to the extent that in 1962 the government subsidized at more than $1bn/year in surplus food storage [Carson, 27][Carson]
* When a ruminating animal feeds on plants with an unusually high concentration of nitrates, microorganisms in the rumen turn nitrates into nitrites, which act on blood pigment to capture oxygen such that it is not released into the tissues. Animals can die from the resultant anoxia within hours. [Carson, 93][Carson]
* Plant wilt after toxic chemical spray (2,4 D) can create a temporary increase in sugar content, which causes grazing animals to prefer even plants they would normally avoid and ingest the sprayed chemicals [Carson, 93][Carson]
* "It has been medically established that, as common sense would tell us, persons who lived and died before the dawn of the DDT era (about 1942) contained no trace of DDT or any similar material in their tissues. As mentioned in Chapter 3, samples of body fat collected from the general population between 1954 and 1956 averaged from 5.3 to 7.4 parts per million of DDT." [Carson, 191][Carson]
* In samples of restaurant and institutional meals, the US Public Health Service determined that every meal contained DDT. [Carson, 191][Carson] //TODO: updated stat?
* The FDA's protection against pesticides on crops is limited due to two facts: 1) they have jurisdiction only over foods shipped interstate and 2) there are fewer than 600 workers on its staff, so they can barely sample (let alone enforce regulations) [Carson, 195][Carson] //TODO updated facts?
* The FDA typically does not ban the presence of toxins in foods, but sets "allowable levels", which means that even approved food can contain enough that toxins build up over time in your body [Carson, 195][Carson]
* Cancer has increased drastically over the past 100-150 years. Malignant growths accounted for 15% of deaths in 1958, compared with 4% in 1900. More American school children [at time of publication] die of cancer than from any other disease, though 25 years previous it was considered medically rare to find cancer in children. [Carson, 231][Carson] //TODO: what are we at now? Office of Vital Statistics as source?
* Past societal collapse theme: population growth --> intensified (unsustainable) agriculture --> adoption of marginal lands for agriculture --> environmental damage --> inability to continue using marginal lands --> food shortages --> starvation/war/weakness and disease, etc. [Diamond, 15][Diamond]
* Eight categories of environmentally based societal collapse: deforestation/habitat destruction, soil erosion/salinization/fertility loss, water management issues, overhunting, overfishing, non-native species effects, overpopulation (human), high impact per capita [Diamond, 15][Diamond]
* The IPCC says we get 90 more years of climate change regardless of how much emission we stop. 2007: 385 PPM CO2. No way to avoid 450 PPM by midcentury according to Pew Center on Global Climate Change [Begley]
* Difference between modern world and past societies which collapsed. Risk-lowering differences: tech advances, globalization, medicine, knowledge of other societies. Risk-heightening differences: unintended effects of tech, global interdependence, dependence on modern medicine for survival, enormous population [Diamond, 11][Diamond]
* Recurring theme in societies that collapse: a series of good years -> population growth -> interdependent society -> less resilience to bad years [Diamond, 97][Diamond]
* Immediate effects of deforestation on Easter Island: damages to soil, decreased crop yields. Further consequences: starvation, population crash, cammibailism [Diamond, 74][Diamond]
* Glacier National Park in the late 1800s had over 150 glaciers, 35 in 2005, at current rates 0 by 2030 [Diamond, 37][Diamond]
* Saline seep is occurring in Montana
