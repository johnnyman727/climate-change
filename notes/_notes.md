# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* Global emissions dipped in 2009 (likely due to the financial crisis) and increased 5.9% in 2010 - largest absolute increase since the Industrial Revolution [Klein, 20][Klein]
* The ~500 million richest humans on earth are responsible for about half of global emissions [Klein, 104][Klein]
* Public spending on the level of wartime expenditures need to occur in order to prevent catastrophic levels of global warming and to mitigate the effects which will reach us. This is largely energy efficiency and public transit expenditure. [Klein, 99][Klein]
* In order to have a 50% chance of keeping below the agreed-upon international target of no more than 2 degrees C of warming, all wealthy countries need to start cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 8-10% immediately [Klein, 81][Klein]
* In the neoliberal era, the rate of emissions growth had been declining: 4.5% annual increases in the 1960s were down to 1% annual increase in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2008, they shot up to 3.4%/year [Klein, 74][Klein]
* Countries are currently allocated responsible for emissions created in their country, not for emissions caused by their consumption. Shipping/etc. in the open ocean is not accounted for. [Klein, 73][Klein]
* Klein's analysis on successful movements for the environment in the last several years: Blockadia (civil disobedience), fossil fuel divestment/reinvestment movement,local laws against high-risk extraction, court challenges by Indigenous groups. [Klein, 407][Klein]
