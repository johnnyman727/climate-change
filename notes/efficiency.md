# Energy efficiency
* NAS reports show that it's much cheaper to make current systems more efficient than it is to create new energy sources [Lovins, 31][Lovins]
* Key targets for energy efficiency gains: transportation, buildings, agriculture, forestry [Lovins, 32][Lovins]
* Long-haul truckers often leave diesel engines in during mandatory 10h rest periods to power "hotel load". Better if they use Auxiliary Power Units and switch off the engine. [Lovins, 138][Lovins]
