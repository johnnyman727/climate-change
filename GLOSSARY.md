# additionality
the assurance to a buyer of a carbon market that the money spent is really eliciting a reduction in carbon

# albedo
reflectivity

# Anthropocene
the name of the current geologic period, implying that the geology of the Earth (through climate change, nuclear fallout, river diversion, monoculture farming, ocean acidification, etc.) is being dominantly affected by humans

# aquaculture
fish farming

# big five extinction
There have been five major losses in species diversity throughout known natural history. These are known as the big five.

# biofuel
a fuel derived from living matter

# Brix
the amount of sugar present in a fruit or vegetable

# calcifiers
organisms that build shells or external skeletons, or for plants, internal scaffolding built from calcium carbonate

# capacity factor
the ratio of a power plant's actual output to its theoretical potential output at full capacity

# carbon cycle
Seasonal cycling of carbon dioxide around the earth, which fluctuates annually between lows in the summer and highs in the winter. Plants and other photosynthesizing organisms consume carbon dioxide in the summer. When the plants die in the fall and cease to photosynthesize, the plants are eaten by bacteria, fungi, and animals, which exhale carbon dioxide. Most of the vegetation on the planet is in the Northern Hemisphere, so the Earth's carbon cycle follows Northern Hemisphere seasons.

# carbon engineering
Geoengineering to pull carbon out of the atmosphere

# CCX
Chicago Climate Exchange

# CDM
Clean Development Mechanism, a flexible mechanism for carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol

# coral bleaching
corals turning white through ejection of their colorful zooxanthellae due to the zooxanthellae's dangerous release of oxygen radicals when ocean waters grow too warm

# cellulosic ethanol
a form of ethanol that can be made from any woody material, such as walnut hulls and lumber waste

# CFCs
chlorofluorocarbons, present in Freon and harmful to the earth's ozone

# COP15
The 2009 Climate Change Convention of the Parties in Copenhagen

# COP21
21st session of the Congress of Parties (UNFCCC) in 2014. Paris.

# Copenhagen Accord
2009 agreement from world leaders to pledge specific actions to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

# declining block rates
The more you buy, the cheaper the price per unit

# DoE
Department of Energy (U.S.A.)

# ETS
Emissions Trading System

# EU ETS
European Union Emissions Trading System (carbon market)

# FCR
feed conversion ratio: in agriculture and aquaculture, the ratio of feed consumed versus pound of weight gained

# geoengineering
Deliberate human intervention in the earth's climate on a global scale

# GHG
greenhouse gas

# greenhouse gases
Atmospheric gases which are transparent to ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but impermeable to infrared (such as the warmth rising from the earth). Carbon dioxide is such a gas.

# Green Revolution
From 1950-1992, a movement to increase food production without bringing more land under cultivation. Related to the work of Norman Borlaug and spread of monocultures.

# helical turbine
A vertical turbine whose blades are modeled after birds' wings

# inverted rates
The more you buy, the more it costs per unit

# IPCC
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a UN organization)

# JI
Joint Implementation, a flexible mechanism for carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol

# Keeling's curve
The mapping of background carbon concentrations on Mauna Loa which by 1962 showed that ~half the CO2 from fossil fuel burning was accumulating in the air.

# kWh
kilowatt hour, the product of the power transmitted in kilowatts and the time in hours

# Kyoto Protocol
An international treaty which extends the UNFCCC, committing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Acknowledges 1 premises: (1) global warming exists and (2) man-made CO2 emissions have caused it. Adopted in 1997, more enforced starting 2005.

# LDG
Latitudinal diversity gradient: the pattern that there is greater species diversity the farther away you get from the poles

# NAS
National Academy of Sciences

# New Pangaea
A term used to refer to the ecological globalization/homogenization of the world through the spreading of non-native species via human activities

# ocean acidification
the reduction of alkalinity in the world's oceans through absoroption of human-produced carbon dioxide from preindustrial levels of 8.2 to a projected 7.8 by 2100

# ocean conveyor
Circulation of the ocean. They move underwater (brought down through sea chimneys) south of Africa, around Antarctica, through the Indian and Pacific Oceans, then come back up at the Atlantic to join the Gulf Stream and move north again to the sea chimney there.

# peak oil
the point in time when the maximum extraction of oil is reached (based on a theory by M. King Hubbert, a Shell researcher)

# pH
pH is a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral, higher is basic (alkaline), and lower is acidic

# phytonutrients
chemical compounds that are the building blocks of taste, such as amino acids, esters, and flavinoids. Also part of plant immune systems.

# PUC
Public Utility Commission, state entity regulating utility companies

# PV
photovoltaic(s)

# refractometer
a tool to measure Brix - looks like a small spyglass

# RGGI
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (New England), the first mandatory, regulated carbon market in the United States

# run-of-the-river
Hydropower which uses natural flow and elevation drop of water rather than a dam

# sea chimneys
Giant whirlpools found at the ends of ocean currents. They take surface water and drain them down to the bottom of the ocean. This is a major component of global ocean circulation.

# Type I
A type of climate change which is gradual, following IPCC graphs

# Type II
A type of climate change that is abrupt and results from the crossing of tipping points

# UNFCCC
1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
