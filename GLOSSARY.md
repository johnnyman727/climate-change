## carbon cycle
Seasonal cycling of carbon dioxide around the earth, which fluctuates annually between lows in the summer and highs in the winter. Plants and other photosynthesizing organisms consume carbon dioxide in the summer. When the plants die in the fall and cease to photosynthesize, the plants are eaten by bacteria, fungi, and animals, which exhale carbon dioxide. Most of the vegetation on the planet is in the Northern Hemisphere, so the Earth's carbon cycle follows Northern Hemisphere seasons.

## fracking
Hydraulic fracturing, a high-pressure injection of a liquid into a wellbore to create cracks in deep-rock formations to access otherwise hard-to-reach natural gas and petroleum

## gas flaring
when oil is extracted, natural gas builds up. "Flaring" this gas is setting it on fire (instead of capturing it for sale).

## geoengineering
Deliberate human intervention in the earth's climate on a global scale

## GHG
greenhouse gas

## greenhouse gases
Atmospheric gases which are transparent to ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but impermeable to infrared (such as the warmth rising from the earth). Carbon dioxide is such a gas.

## green manures
quick-growing plants that help prevent erosion and replace nutrients in soil

## Green Revolution
From 1950-1992, a movement to increase food production without bringing more land under cultivation. Related to the work of Norman Borlaug and spread of monocultures.

## helical turbine
A vertical turbine whose blades are modeled after birds' wings

## HVDC
High voltage DC power

## intercropping
planting two or more crops interspersed to maximize light, water, and nutrient usage

## inverted rates
The more you buy, the more it costs per unit

## IPCC
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a UN organization)

## JI
Joint Implementation, a flexible mechanism for carbon markets under the Kyoto Protocol

## Keeling's curve
The mapping of background carbon concentrations on Mauna Loa which by 1962 showed that ~half the CO2 from fossil fuel burning was accumulating in the air.

## kWh
kilowatt hour, the product of the power transmitted in kilowatts and the time in hours

## Kyoto Protocol
An international treaty which extends the UNFCCC, committing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Acknowledges 1 premises: (1) global warming exists and (2) man-made CO2 emissions have caused it. Adopted in 1997, more enforced starting 2005.

## LDG
Latitudinal diversity gradient: the pattern that there is greater species diversity the farther away you get from the poles

## NAS
National Academy of Sciences

## New Pangaea
A term used to refer to the ecological globalization/homogenization of the world through the spreading of non-native species via human activities

## NIMBY
Not in my backyard. As in "yes high voltage power transmission is a great idea, but not in my backyard"

## NREL
National Renewable Energy Laboratory

## ocean acidification
the reduction of alkalinity in the world's oceans through absoroption of human-produced carbon dioxide from preindustrial levels of 8.2 to a projected 7.8 by 2100

## ocean conveyor
Circulation of the ocean. They move underwater (brought down through sea chimneys) south of Africa, around Antarctica, through the Indian and Pacific Oceans, then come back up at the Atlantic to join the Gulf Stream and move north again to the sea chimney there.

## peak oil
the point in time when the maximum extraction of oil is reached (based on a theory by M. King Hubbert, a Shell researcher)

## People's Recovery
The use of destruction from catastrophic events as an opportunity to rebuild with equity in mind

## pH
pH is a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral, higher is basic (alkaline), and lower is acidic

## run-of-the-river
Hydropower which uses natural flow and elevation drop of water rather than a dam

## salinization
Salt accumulation in soil and groundwater, which interferes with the ability for plants to grow [Diamond, 35][Diamond]

## saline seep
Salty water which builds up in an uphill area travels through the soil and comes out downhill and distant. [Diamond, 36][Diamond]

## sea chimneys
Giant whirlpools found at the ends of ocean currents. They take surface water and drain them down to the bottom of the ocean. This is a major component of global ocean circulation.
