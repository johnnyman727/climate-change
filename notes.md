## The basics
* The earth is getting warmer, and it's creating nasty positive feedback loops. For example: Sea ice is melting; ice is more reflective than water, so heat gets absorbed by the water more quickly than before; sea ice melts even faster
* The primary cause of global warming is CO2 going into the atmosphere, specifically due to the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum. [Victor]
* Nobody's exactly sure what will happen and when, but so far it's gotten worse more quickly than mainstream models predicted.
* CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were evidence that humans were massively impacting the environment and creating a hole in the ozone layer. Political action banning specific chemical products was fairly decisive in reducing this issue.
* There is no decisive political action that can be taken regarding carbon emissions, because any that would actually work would also shut down the global economy.
