## The basics
* The earth is getting warmer, and it's creating nasty positive feedback loops. For example: Sea ice is melting; ice is more reflective than water, so heat gets absorbed by the water more quickly than before; sea ice melts even faster
* The primary cause of global warming is CO2 going into the atmosphere, specifically due to the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum. [Victor]
* Nobody's exactly sure what will happen and when, but so far it's gotten worse more quickly than mainstream models predicted.
* CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were evidence that humans were massively impacting the environment and creating a hole in the ozone layer. Political action banning specific chemical products was fairly decisive in reducing this issue.
* There is no decisive political action that can be taken regarding carbon emissions, because any that would actually work would also shut down the global economy.
* Paris Agreement is in process of ratification as of May 2016. This agreement, if ratified, establishes the goal of limiting climate change to 1.5-2 degrees C above preindustrial levels and creates a process for emissions cuts. [Sutter][SutterParis]
* Fastest and cheapest way to prevent chaotic climates: stop deforestation. Loss of tropical forests accounts for up to 25% of GHG emissions [Lovins, 239][Lovins]
* We are in the Anthropocene because: (1) human activity has transformed 1/3-1/2 of the land surface of the planet (2) most of the world's major rivers have been dammed or diverted (3) fertilizer plants produce more nitrogen than is fixed naturally by terrestrial ecosystems (4) fisheries remove more than 1/3 of the primary production of the ocean's coastal waters (5) humans use more than half the world's readily accessible freshwater runoff (6) humans have altered the composition of the atmosphere [Kolbert, 108][Kolbert]
* "Owing to a combination of fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has risen by forty percent over the last two centuries, while the concentration of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas, has doubled." [Kolbert, 108][Kolbert]

## Historical precedent
* Most of the Ordovician period had a greenhouse climate (high CO2 levels in the air, high sea level, high temperature). Rapid drop in CO2 levels resulted in a big five extinction (according to current theory). [Kolbert, 183][Kolbert]
* Colder water holds more oxygen [Kolbert, 183][Kolbert]
* The end-Permian extinction (a big five extinction event) appears to have been triggered by a rapid rise in CO2/climate. Ocean temperatures rose ~18 degrees F, waters became more acidic and lost oxygen. 90% of species on earth became extinct over a period of 100-200k years. [Kolbert, 183][Kolbert]
