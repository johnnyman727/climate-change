* Geoengineering: "the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" (Royal society paper, in [Goodell, 16])
* Two main approaches to geoengineering: carbon engineering & engineering of the earth's albedo [Goodell, 17]
* Carbon engineering less controversial than albedo engineering, more similar to Earth's natural carbon cycle. E.g. air scrubbers, iron in the ocean to create plankton blooms, huge plantations of trees [Goodell, 17]
* Albedo engineering to change reflectivity of the earth- painting roofs and roads white, injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere [Goodell, 17]
* With albedo engineering, blocking 2% of Earth's sunlight returns climate to preindustrial levels - though this doesn't fix the other problems high CO2 causes [Goodell, 17]
