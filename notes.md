## The basics
* The earth is getting warmer, and it's creating nasty positive feedback loops. For example: Sea ice is melting; ice is more reflective than water, so heat gets absorbed by the water more quickly than before; sea ice melts even faster
* The primary cause of global warming is CO2 going into the atmosphere, specifically due to the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum. [Victor]
* Nobody's exactly sure what will happen and when, but so far it's gotten worse more quickly than mainstream models predicted.
* CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were evidence that humans were massively impacting the environment and creating a hole in the ozone layer. Political action banning specific chemical products was fairly decisive in reducing this issue.
* There is no decisive political action that can be taken regarding carbon emissions, because any that would actually work would also shut down the global economy.

## Clean energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* Solar and wind are currently expensive to implement, but it's possible to significantly reduce cost for materials/transport/setup without a technological breakthrough, e.g. wind turbines on kites [Victor]
* Improved software, especially modeling (where should my wind turbine go?) can dramatically increase the efficiency of existing technologies [Victor]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]

## Geoengineering
* Geoengineering: "the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" (Royal society paper, in [p16][Goodell])
* Two main approaches to geoengineering: carbon engineering & engineering of the earth's albedo [p17][Goodell]
* Main promise of geoengineering: delay inevitable catastrophic warming of the earth. It's a desperate measure, but it seems likely that we'll have to use it at some point [p115][Goodell]
* Three main arguments against geoengineering: (1) we don't understand the system we're messing with and we'd be likely to mess it up in a really catastrophic way. (2) geoengineering distracts from the main problem, which is that we're still emitting too many greenhouse gases and need to figure out how to stop doing that. (3) Western civilization in the modern era is unsustainable regardless of the planet's temperature, and we'd end up depleting even more resources on the industry of planetary cooling [pp18-21][Goodell]

### Albedo engineering
* Albedo engineering to change reflectivity of the earth- painting roofs and roads white, injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere [p17][Goodell]
* With albedo engineering, blocking 2% of Earth's sunlight returns climate to preindustrial levels - though this doesn't fix the other problems high CO2 causes [p17][Goodell]
* Best way to have a quick impact and stop Arctic ice from melting is albedo engineering, which is either brightening clouds or filling the stratosphere with particles. Either of these could in theory cool the Arctic quickly enough to immediately stop ice melt. [p114][Goodell]

#### Particles injected into the stratosphere
* We know for sure that particles in the atmosphere can cool the planet by a degree or two because that has happened with some big volcanoes in the past.
* How do you inject the stratosphere with particles? Teller & Wood looked into this problem: for $1 billion/year, set off an artificial volcano every 5-6 years full of particles 1/10th of a micron in diameter made of some nonreactive metallic substance [p123][Goodell]
* Testing the stratospheric albedo approach: over 70 deg latitude, shade 20% to stop melting; 50% to grow the ice. The particles would rain out in a year or so. (Caldeira) [p127][Goodell]
* Particles in the stratosphere might trigger the creation of chlorine, which degrades the ozone [p131][Goodell]
* Particles in the stratosphere might affect monsoons and destroy agriculture [p132][Goodell]
* If we stopped putting particles in the air, the heat would come back right away [p133][Goodell]

#### Cloud brightening
* Smaller particles are more reflective than bigger particles of the same substance. Making the water droplets smaller could make them brighter [p169][Goodell]
* Spraying atomized salt water from the ocean into the air could make the moisture in clouds form around the salt, which would be smaller particules than their current form [p169][Goodell]
* According to Latham, 50-70% of the world's ocean-covering clouds would have to be brightened in order to offset a doubling of CO2 [p182][Goodell]
* This could impact global weather patterns, esp. rainfall [p184][Goodell]

### Carbon engineering
* Carbon engineering is less controversial than albedo engineering, more similar to Earth's natural carbon cycle. E.g. air scrubbers, iron in the ocean to create plankton blooms, huge plantations of trees [p17][Goodell]
* Plankton blooms: if we dump several tons of iron into the ocean, we can cause a phytoplankton bloom. Phytoplankton are 1% of photosynthetic material but take in 50% of the carbon on Earth, then sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die (trapping carbon for centuries-millennia) [p137][Goodell]
* Not sure what would eat the phytoplankton, and not sure what changing the nutritional balance of the ocean would do to other life forms [p137][Goodell]

## Economic approach
### Carbon credits
* Carbon credits system: a global economic system to financially incentivize companies to reduce their carbon emissions [p142][Goodell]
* [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) established the carbon credits system in 1997/enforced 2005. Each nation decides on a cap, then can trade for more/less with other nations [p142][Goodell]
* Prior art: the Acid Rain Program cut sulfur dioxide emissions quickly and cheaply using a similar credits system [p141][Goodell]

### Capitalism
* Using less energy/using renewables can save companies money - Walmart is a leading example [p12][Lovins]
* Companies required to disclose accounting information including carbon footprint under the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanesâ€“Oxley_Act). This lets the public see economic effect of cutting emissions; the trend has been cost savings [p11][Lovins]
* Major $ savings to be had in more efficient buildings; 76% of energy produced in USA goes to building operation [p15][Lovins]
* Biggest blocker to companies that would like to go greener: up-front capital [p31][Lovins]
