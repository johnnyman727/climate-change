## The basics
* The earth is getting warmer, and it's creating nasty positive feedback loops. For example: Sea ice is melting; ice is more reflective than water, so heat gets absorbed by the water more quickly than before; sea ice melts even faster
* Nobody's exactly sure what will happen and when, but so far it's gotten worse more quickly than mainstream models predicted.
* CFCs (cholofluorocarbons) were evidence that humans were massively impacting the environment and creating a hole in the ozone layer. Political action banning specific chemical products was fairly decisive in reducing this issue.
* There is no decisive political action that can be taken regarding carbon emissions, because any that would actually work would also shut down the global economy.

## Geoengineering
* Geoengineering: "the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" (Royal society paper, in [16][Goodell])
* Two main approaches to geoengineering: carbon engineering & engineering of the earth's albedo [17][Goodell]
* Carbon engineering less controversial than albedo engineering, more similar to Earth's natural carbon cycle. E.g. air scrubbers, iron in the ocean to create plankton blooms, huge plantations of trees [17][Goodell]
* Albedo engineering to change reflectivity of the earth- painting roofs and roads white, injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere [17][Goodell]
* We know for sure that particles in the atmosphere can cool the planet by a degree or two because that has happened with some big volcanoes in the past.
* With albedo engineering, blocking 2% of Earth's sunlight returns climate to preindustrial levels - though this doesn't fix the other problems high CO2 causes [17][Goodell]
* Main promise of geoengineering: delay inevitable catastrophic warming of the earth. It's a desperate measure, but it seems likely that we'll have to use it at some point [115][Goodell]
* Three main arguments against geoengineering: (1) we don't understand the system we're messing with and we'd be likely to mess it up in a really catastrophic way. (2) geoengineering distracts from the main problem, which is that we're still emitting too many greenhouse gases and need to figure out how to stop doing that. (3) Western civilization in the modern era is unsustainable regardless of the planet's temperature, and we'd end up depleting even more resources on the industry of planetary cooling [18-21][Goodell]
* Best way to have a quick impact and stop Arctic ice from melting is albedo engineering, which is either brightening clouds or filling the stratosphere with particles. Either of these could in theory cool the Arctic quickly enough to immediately stop ice melt. [114][Goodell]
