## Questions/blog post ideas
* How are utility companies incentivized/disincentivized re energy use reductions?
* Pros/cons: nuclear power
* How much would oil have to cost for X alternative biofuel to make sense - esp waste products like polystyrene, coffee grounds, human fat etc
* How to create sustainable reasonably priced alternative to personal car ownership for disabled? Electric Uber with self driving much cheaper?
* What industries use diesel/wouldn't need retrofit to switch to biofuel?
* Consumption of diesel vs production of biofuel over time
* How exactly does the carbon cycle work and how can we manipulate it
* What is the carbon "exchange rate" of not driving cars vs. planting trees vs. etc.? Planting 8777 trees = taking 9.33 cars off the road = 111940 roads removed [Lovins, 71][Lovins]
* What $ savings/investments can be made for various energy efficiency improvements?
* How does ethanol vs. oil-based fuel work?
* Original car inventors envisioned ethanol as the primary fuel for the vehicle. Why did we make the switch?

## Engineering/wild ideas
* Electric car batteries when not in use as a distributed power storage network for a city/community [Lovins, 94][Lovins]
* Building efficiency is a big waste of energy, people would fix their own if they knew how much. How can we make thermal scans/cameras more accessible such that people can scan for energy loss easily?

## Entrepreneurship
* Training construction workers in how to build cheaper, more efficient sites using green techniques (many only know one way of building a given thing/now a little out of date)

## Further research
* Retrospective on Kyoto Protocol Phase 1 outcomes
* Other phases of Kyoto Protocol?
