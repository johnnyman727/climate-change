## Successes
* Klein's analysis on successful movements for the environment in the last several years: Blockadia (civil disobedience), fossil fuel divestment/reinvestment movement,local laws against high-risk extraction, court challenges by Indigenous groups. [Klein, 407][Klein]

## Questions/blog post ideas
* How are utility companies incentivized/disincentivized re energy use reductions?
* Pros/cons: nuclear power
* How much would oil have to cost for X alternative biofuel to make sense - esp waste products like polystyrene, coffee grounds, human fat etc
* How to create sustainable reasonably priced alternative to personal car ownership for disabled? Electric Uber with self driving much cheaper?
* What industries use diesel/wouldn't need retrofit to switch to biofuel?
* Consumption of diesel vs production of biofuel over time
* How exactly does the carbon cycle work and how can we manipulate it
* What is the carbon "exchange rate" of not driving cars vs. planting trees vs. etc.? Planting 8777 trees = taking 9.33 cars off the road = 111940 roads removed [Lovins, 71][Lovins]
* What $ savings/investments can be made for various energy efficiency improvements?
* How does ethanol vs. oil-based fuel work?
* Original car inventors envisioned ethanol as the primary fuel for the vehicle. Why did we make the switch?
* Blockadia phrased as a war, with death/injury counts of protestors and police
* SequoiaView for utilities usage - ability to drill down to see who is using how much of what
* How to eat to minimize carbon footprint
* How power is lost in the grid system and ideas to combat this

## Engineering/wild ideas
* Electric car batteries when not in use as a distributed power storage network for a city/community [Lovins, 94][Lovins]
* Building efficiency is a big waste of energy, people would fix their own if they knew how much. How can we make thermal scans/cameras more accessible such that people can scan for energy loss easily?

## Entrepreneurship
* Training construction workers in how to build cheaper, more efficient sites using green techniques (many only know one way of building a given thing/now a little out of date)
* Leveraging higher numbers of HVDC lines in China to transport renewable power efficiently? ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/HVDC-Lines-in-US-and-China-800x522.jpg) [Naam][NaamWind]
* A way to let consumers choose their own power source
* A way to break out energy usage by type [Friedman]
* Funding/help from emerging technology departments at utility companies
* Ways to help balance peak loads
* Preventative maintenance ideas
* "Smart grid" space
