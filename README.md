## Why research this?

There are a lot of problems with the world. A lot of the major issues (war, human displacement, destruction of natural spaces, etc.) lead back fairly directly to issues with energy.

Climate change is one of the symptoms of the issues surrounding human use of energy. But it's also the issue which has most directly driven research towards energy solutions.

I want to learn more about the crisis which is most likely to kill humanity on a short time scale, get a sense of how this will occur, and see what solutions have been explored in this space.
