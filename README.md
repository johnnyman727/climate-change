Climate Change
========================

Personal notes as I explore the subject of climate change.

## Why research this?

There are a lot of problems with the world. A lot of the major issues (war, human displacement, destruction of natural spaces, etc.) lead back fairly directly to issues with energy.

Climate change is one of the symptoms of the issues surrounding human use of energy. But it's also the issue which has most directly driven research towards energy solutions.

I want to learn more about the crisis which is most likely to kill humanity on a short time scale, get a sense of how this will occur, and see what solutions have been explored in this space.

## How do I use this book?

If you're in the Gitbook, you can hover over or click on links. Underlined links are glossary terms (hover or click to read descriptions); non-underlined links are citations - hover to read bibliography or click to access articles or links to books.

## How is this organized?

Main sections have an introduction to what is there; they will also have a "stubs" section for unsorted notes and pieces which don't yet deserve their own sections.

Glossary section includes some pieces which are not necessarily mentioned in the notes. They should serve as an introduction to the key terms and description of processes in the space.

Bibliography section is annotated with a basic description per source, but I haven't yet found a good way to have it display in the gitbook. Work in progress.

Areas of opportunity is a great place to start if you're looking for ways an engineer might work in this space or what some key questions might be.
